# android-coding-challenge

Currently the simple app fetches a list of countries and displays them.

Documentation for used API: https://restcountries.com/

Your task is to continue development reaching the following milestones: 

- list should show only European countries
- list should show each countries capital too as well as its flag
- the layout of the item should show the flag on the left of texts and look OK
- upon clicking an item a detail screen should open showing population and area additionally

Emphasize quality and testing, this should be a work sample that meets your professional standards.
Leave comments for what you leave for later but deem important or any assumptions you make. 

Also feel free to use this file to add general notes or whatever you would like to document. 

Reserve 2-3 hours or less for this task (maybe you have reference projects handy). 
If more time is needed you might go overboard. Remember you can also comment open tasks.
