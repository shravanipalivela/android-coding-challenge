# android-coding-challenge

Currently the simple app fetches a list of countries and displays them.

Documentation for used API: https://restcountries.com/

Your task is to continue development reaching the following milestones: 

- list should show only European countries
- list should show each countries capital too as well as its flag
- the layout of the item should show the flag on the left of texts and look OK
- upon clicking an item a new screen should open
- BONUS the new screen should show a map at the countries capital

Emphasize code quality, the HOW is what's important. 
For what you wouldn't want to implement leave comments.
